I think it will take me atleast 3 days to complete this challenge starting from tommorow.

Process

from the looks of it top part is background with multiple colors
- this is the image that are give to us
and on top of that background there are two card one shows the front and another the back and in the smaller screen their layout changes
 - I can use flexbox to arrange their layout and use padding or something like that to create their placements
 - these card are imgs that are given to us, along with all the design we requires as png and svg
 - there are dummy card number and other detail, which will be replaced when the user inputs their card detail and this happens without clicking the submission btn, it happens almost simultaneously


then comes the form element
-
